# The C Programming Language 
Welcome!
This is an attempt to make a definitive flashcard version of the book: The C Programming Language
The tips for contributing to this project:
  - try to make the cards as simple as possible so that it is easy to remember e.g. by using cloze cards or by using the Immage Occlusion addon
  - Cards should be made in their approiate deck. e.g. a flashcard with keywords as theme could be placed in Appendix A - Reference Manual Deck -> 02 Lexical Tokens Deck-> 04 Keywords Deck
  - Have fun learning the cards and contributing to the knowledge of others
  - More TBA
  
##### Instructions taken from [CrowdAnki](https://desktop.github.com/)
  - Check his project page to find the CLI intructions
 
#### To start working on the deck you need to:
1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for their computer.
2. You can do that by going to the repository page on GitHub and pressing "Clone or download -> Open in Desktop".

3. [Import the deck](#import).

If you **just wants to use the deck** you can [import decks directly from there](#import-from-git).

#### How to upload changes

When you want to upload changes you've made to the GitHub, you need to:

1. Get the latest changes from the GitHub, by pressing "Sync" button in the top right corner.

2. [Import the deck](#import) to combine changes you've made with the changes other people have made.
3. Export the deck the same directory where your repository is located so that export will overwrite media directory and JSON file in the repository. (As an alternative you can export it elsewhere and copy JSON file and media directory yourself to overwrite the ones that are in repository directory.)
4. Add the changes you've made to the repository, by selecting all of the files, adding some comment in comment field and pressing "Commit to master"

5. Upload changes you've made to the GitHub, by pressing "Sync" button in the top right corner.

If you just want to **get latest changes from other people** - you need to perform only steps 1 and 2.
